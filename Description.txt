I want to create a website with a quiz for my family to play on christmas day. The user selects their name from a dropdown and based on that name a set of questions and answers is loaded from a json or csv file. The user can answer 1 question at a time thourgh a dropdown with the possible answers. If the answer is wrong, they have to wait 5 seconds while a countdown is shown. if they answer correctly, the next question is shown. Once they complete the quiz, a personalized image is shown.
